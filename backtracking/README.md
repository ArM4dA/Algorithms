# Backtracking
## Description
`Backtracking` is a recursive algorithm that checks conditions and builds up the solution step by step but immediately discards (tracks backward) it when it gets false. 
It is different from `Brute-Force` because it checks the constraints first and constructs the solution unlike brute-force which generates all possible combinations to check one by one. If one of the constraint fails, it will immediately backtrack and initiate a different solution combination. Hence, backtracking can be considered an `Optimal Brute-Force`
