# Dynamic Programming
## Description
`Dynamic Programming` is an optimized recursive algorithm for problems that require repeated function calls. The concept is to store the results of subproblems to avoid recomputing them later. This simple storage reduces time complexity from exponential to polynomial.
A good example is `Fibonacci Series`. If we use plain recursion, it has an exponential time complexity. Using `Dynamic Programming` we can reduce it to linear time complexity.
